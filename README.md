### Virtual-DOM

Using the `virtual-dom` and `html-to-vdom` packages to create a modular View rendering engine.

Use: `npm run dev` and open your browser to http://localhost:8080/dist/ to see it in action

The magic happens in [src/View.js](https://github.com/JamesNimlos/virtual-dom-practice/blob/master/src/View.js)

This code is UNTESTED in a production environment.
